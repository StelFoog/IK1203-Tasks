# IK1203-Tasks

My solutions to the tasks for KTH course IK1203 Networking and Communication

## Status

- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4

#### Task 1 - TCP Client

Implement a TCP client, called TCPAsk. TCPAsk operates in a straight-forward manner:

1.  Open a TCP connection to a server at a given host address and port number.
2.  Take any data that the server sends, and and print the data.
3.  TCPAsk takes an optional string as parameter. This string is sent as data to the server when the TCP connection is opened, followed by a newline character (linefeed '\n').

#### Task 2 - HTTP Echo Server

Implement a TCP server, called HTTPEcho. HTTPEcho does the following:

1.  Opens up a server on a given port number.
2.  The server replies with a valid HTTP response and echoes any data sent.

#### Task 3 - HTTPAsk Server

`TODO`

#### Task 4 - Concurrent HTTPAsk Server
